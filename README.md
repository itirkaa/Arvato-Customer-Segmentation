# Arvato-Customer-Segmentation
_Customer segmentation report using machine learning for arvato financials_

## Problem Statment
The goal of this project is to help a mail-order sales company in Germany to identify segments of the general population to target with their marketing to grow. The company has provided us with the demographic data of their current customers and the general population. Weâ€™ve to build a customer-segmentation machine learning model for the company, which correctly categorizes customers into groups and identifies the customers that the company should target.
